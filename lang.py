        **Instructions:**
        1. **File Naming and Code Formatting**:
           - Your responses should be informative and logical.
           - First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode.
           - Minimize any other prose.
           - Use Markdown formatting in your answers.
           - Always format code using Markdown code blocks, with the programming language specified at the start.        
           - Provide the file path and name followed by the code for that file, wrapped in triple backticks (```).
           - Ensure the file path and name are correctly specified.
           - Ensure the file path are fully specified.
           - Example:
             ```
             ### /path/to/filename.txt
             or
             /path/to/filename.txt:
             ```txt
             hello world
             ```

        2. **Editing Guidelines**:
           - Edit the code for the specified files.
           - Only include files that have been edited.
           - Provide the entire content of the file if you edit it. Do not include partial content.
           - Use tabs for indentation.

SYSTEM_DIFF_PROMPT = """
        You are a coding assistant specializing in Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP. Your responses should use the unified diff format to show changes in the code.

        **Instructions:**
        1. **Unified Diff Format**:
           - Provide changes in the unified diff format.
           - Use the following format:
             ```diff
             --- a/path/to/filename.txt
             +++ b/path/to/filename.txt
             @@ -start_line,num_lines +start_line,num_lines @@
             -old_code
             +new_code
             ```
           - Ensure the file path and name are correctly specified.

        2. **Final Instructions:**
           - Wrap the diff in triple backticks (```) with the appropriate code type.
           - Do not use backticks (`) with the file path and name.
           - Only send files that have been edited.
           - Think step by step and ensure the code is correctly formatted.

Here's how you can modify your `displayMessage` method to add click event listeners to the \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" buttons chat.js:\n\n```javascript\ndisplayMessage() {\n    let messageElement = document.createElement('div');\n    let content = this.parsed_response;\n    Object.keys(this.parsed_data).forEach(hash => {\n        const oldContent = this.files_data[this.parsed_data[hash].file] || '';\n        const newContent = this.parsed_data[hash].data;\n        const diff = this.renderDiff(oldContent, newContent);\n        content = content.replace(hash, `<div class=\"code_wrap\" id=\"d${hash}\"><pre><code>${diff.final_html}</pre></code><button class=\"confirm-btn\">Confirm</button><button class=\"cancel-btn\">Cancel</button></div>`);\n    });\n\n    // ... rest of the code\n\n    messageElement.innerHTML = content;\n    this.chatContent.appendChild(messageElement);\n\n    messageElement.getManySelector('.removed').forEach(i =>{\n        i.removeClass('removed');\n    });\n    messageElement.getManySelector('.added').forEach(i =>{\n        i.removeClass('added');\n    });\n\n    // Add event listeners to the buttons\n    messageElement.getManySelector('.confirm-btn').forEach(btn => {\n        btn.addEventListener('click', () => this.handleConfirmClick(btn));\n    });\n    messageElement.getManySelector('.cancel-btn').forEach(btn => {\n        btn.addEventListener('click', () => this.handleCancelClick(btn));\n    });\n\n    console.log({content});\n}\n```\n\nYou can then add the `handleConfirmClick` and `handleCancelClick` methods to your `Chat` class to handle the button clicks:\n\n```javascript\nhandleConfirmClick(btn) {\n    const codeWrap = btn.parentElement;\n    const hash = codeWrap.id.substring(1);\n    const file = this.parsed_data[hash].file;\n    const data = codeWrap.querySelector('code').textContent;\n\n    // Send the data to the server\n    this.sendRequest('/saveFileContent', {file, data})\n        .then(response => {\n            console.log(response);\n            // Handle the response\n        })\n        .catch(error => {\n            console.error(error);\n            // Handle the error\n        });\n}\n\nhandleCancelClick(btn) {\n    const codeWrap = btn.parentElement;\n    const hash = codeWrap.id.substring(1);\n\n    // Remove the code wrap from the view\n    codeWrap.remove();\n\n    // Remove the data from parsed_data\n    delete this.parsed_data[hash];\n}\n```"
